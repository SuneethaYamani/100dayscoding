# Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
# Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

# Fizz Buzz
Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

Example:

n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]

# Count Primes
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Example:

Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
# Power of Three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Example 1:

Input: 27
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: false
